    "storytellerObjective": "This project was carried out as an end-of-year assignment during my first year of work-study training at IFAPME in Charleroi. The goal was to put into practice the skills acquired during the year, which is why the project is written in PHP. The application aims to provide a collaborative writing platform inspired by the 'cadavre exquis' game: anyone can start a story, limited by a number of words, then another person can continue the story, and so on.",
    "storytellerResponsabilities": "For this project, I designed almost all of the layout myself, drawing inspiration from the style of a real written newspaper, notably the New York Times. I also tackled several technical challenges: setting up a secure registration and login system, designing a MySQL schema suited to the planned features, and developing all user interactions (adding and continuing stories, likes, search, etc.).",
    "storytellerObstacles": "The main challenge of this project was to design a user interface that was both aesthetic and functional, while respecting the technical constraints of PHP. I also had to learn how to manage interactions with a MySQL database, which was new to me at the time. Finally, I encountered an issue with slow loading of story pages, which I solved by implementing efficient pagination and asynchronous content loading.",
